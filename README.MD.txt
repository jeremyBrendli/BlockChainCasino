Make sure to spend alot of ether or else the withdraw functions won't return any money because
the smart contract doesn't have enough money in it's balance and you can't create money out of thin air.
I'd recomend purchasing chips at the slots because they cost 1 ether then spending those chips elsewhere so you don't over whelm the smart contract with withraw amounts larger than it's balance.
